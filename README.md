These are my personal setting files. Currently for VIM, bash (with homebrew settings for Mac OS X) and global gitignore.

## Usage
1. Download the dotfiles by running `git clone git@github.com:frecon/dotfiles.git` in the terminal.
2. Symlink each file manually to your home folder. For example `ln -s .vimrc ~/.vimrc`

I'm also using Dropbox so the files get automatically updated on each computer.
